# Customer Experience (CX) Journey Analytics - Candidate Case Study

## Introduction
This is a case study I completed as part of the interview process for Vanguard. This project demonstrates my expertise in web analytics, SQL, and A/B testing.

## Objective
As a newly hired Lead Analyst for a CX lab, I am tasked with preparing a digital readout on an experiment that was run before I was hired.

### Experiment Design & Hypothesis
The experiment was run as an A/B test from 3/15/2017 to 4/30/2017. The hypothesis is that a more modern UI and in-context prompts would make clients feel more comfortable with the digital journey, therefore leading to clients completing the process at a higher rate. 

The control group was exposed to the current state (the outdated UI). The test group received a redesigned experience with improved UI, navigation, and in-line help. The number of process steps or pages remains the same for both groups. 

### Datasets
Analysis for this case study was based on three datasets:
- **Client demographic information** which contained data on a client’s age, gender, tenure, number of accounts, and calls/logons for the past six months. 
- **Web activity** at the hit level for a client’s session and pages visited.
- **Experiment split** identifying the client ID and the experiment variation.

### Results
This case study includes two files with the final results:  
1. The SQL file that I used to clean and transform the data.
2. The PowerPoint presentation that served as the readout on the results of the experiment.
